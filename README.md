# What is Bloom?
*bloom - the collective noun for jellyfish*

Bloom is a knowledge base of information from a newbie ethical hacker. It is a combination of an Obsidian notebook, an mdBook, and a GitHub Pages in one place.

## Contents
This notebook will contain:
* Tools and Resources that I encounter while doing research. Things like books, articles, videos, YouTube channels, other writeups of challenges. 
* Sites and CTFs to practice and improve skills
* My own Writeups of the sites and CTFs, if they allow it.

This notebook will not contain any scripts, as that will be in a different repository (which will be linked later)

## Why?
I wanted documentation for myself to use, but also to note progress. Yet another reference point for people who encounter this as they go on their adventure too.

Thank you! If you know of any tools or resources, I would like to be informed through... (somewhere, I'll link later)
